This repository is an example of how to use Laragon and WordPress. It uses our local development environment, Laragon. For more information on Laragon, [check out the documentation](https://laragon.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Open up a command line prompt.
2. Clone the repo.
3. You should now have a fully functional local WordPress site at [``](http://wordpress-nginx.docker.amazee.io)!

## WordPress and Composer

This setup uses Composer with WordPress. If you're looking for more information on using Composer and WordPress together, go check out http://composer.rarst.net.

*Note*: When installing plugins, do not install them through the UI. Either use Composer or the WordPress CLI (included in this example). For more information on how to use the WordPress CLI, [check out the documentation](https://wp-cli.org/).
