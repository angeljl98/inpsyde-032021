Booster Extension is a free WordPress plugin that supercharges your site with awesome powerful features. There’re numerous plugins in the official WordPress repository that promises to provide the features that we offer, however if you install them all, there’s inconsistency in their backend and frontend styles and possible plugin conflicts. That’s why we've created Booster Extension, adding all the essentials components for every WordPress blog or magazine.
